NoEncryptionX is a Minecraft server plugin originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/Doclic/" target="_blank">Doclic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/V1nc3ntWasTaken/" target="_blank">V1nc3ntWasTaken</a>,
now updated and maintained for newer versions by <a href="https://github.com/ineanto/" target="_blank">Ineanto</a>
(me!).

NoEncryptionX is a Minecraft plugin intended to <b>combat against</b> the new chat reporting system implemented in 1.19
by safely removing encryption.

## What versions does NoEncryptionX support?

NoEncryptionX supports versions <code>1.19</code> through <code>1.21.8</code>.

## How does NoEncryptionX work?

NoEncryptionX works by <b>stripping</b> messages of their signatures,
leaving <b>no way</b> for a client to <b>validate</b> that a chat message or command came from a certain player,
thus making your messages un-reportable. 
NoEncryptionX modifies outbound packets specifically to allow other plugins, such as chat managers, 
to properly modify chat contents before reaching NoEncryptionX.

## Where are the config files?

NoEncryptionX stores its files under <code>plugins/NoEncryptionX/</code>.

## Is there any way to remove the gray bar and indent?

Currently, there is <b>no way</b> to remove the gray bar and indent without the use of texture packs.
This is because it is in the clientside code to include the gray bar for unsigned messages,
and always include the indentation.
There is an available texture pack that solves this issue,
which can be found <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hide-chat-toasts-and-chat-bars/version/2.0">here</a>.

## Isn't injecting into a player's connection a security vulnerability?

The NoEncryptionX packet handler is designed to intercept only certain packet types,
such as <b>ClientboundPlayerChatPacket</b>,
<b>ClientboundPlayerChatHeaderPacket</b>, and <b>ClientboundServerDataPacket</b>
(to block the annoying popup).
<br>
When one of these packets is detected, its contents are stored
and a brand-new packet is created in place of it,
reusing the contents that were stored from the original packet,
and dropping certain contents such as the signature and the salt.
